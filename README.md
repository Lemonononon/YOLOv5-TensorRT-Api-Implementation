# YOLOv5 TensorRT C++ Api Implementation
Implementation of YOLOv5m in TensorRT C++ API.

As we all know, YOLOv5 has many versions. The YOLOv5 project I'm using is inherited from someone else, and I can no longer determine the version. Since the network structure does not match any version I've seen on the official site, I speculate that this is an intermediate version between v1 and v2.
You will know the network structure from yolov5m.yaml.
